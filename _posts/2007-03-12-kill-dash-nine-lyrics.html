by Monzy. " I guess I'll have to shut you down for good this time, Already tried a SIGQUIT,  so now it's KILL DASH 9.  You gotta learn when it's time for your thread to yield; It shoulda slept; instead you stepped and now your fate is sealed. <a href="http://www.monzy.com/intro/killdashnine_lyrics.html">Kill Dash Nine Lyrics</a><br /><br /> (-: Music 4 Nerds :-)
