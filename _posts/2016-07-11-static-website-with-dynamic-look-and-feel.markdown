Well hello there!  Some thoughts on how the inter-web is changing.  JavaScript has looong been a little helper to websites.  Nowadays though, JavaScript is to be overtaking Java for incredibly fast end-to-end internet solutions.  I have always (from the late 1990-ties) held the opinion JavaScript is more Object Oriented than Java.  Why does this matter?  Because I believe Smalltalk is **still** the mother of about all computer languages!
