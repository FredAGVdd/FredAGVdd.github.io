<p>Gemstones, ruby gems, gemstones (again but different :-) ...</p>
<p>Ruby, Ruby Saphire - all sounds nice but I haven't seen much glitter - yet ?</p>
<p>Ruby-In-Steel may sound less but the IDE appears to be providing just a tad more functionality than notepad, wordpad, textpad .exe!<br />
However, I think it's a shame the free language is best enjoyed with an expensive IDE.</p>
