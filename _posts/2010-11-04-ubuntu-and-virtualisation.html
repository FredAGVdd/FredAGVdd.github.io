<p>It's always nice to catch up with a few things one has been delaying for (say) weeks...</p>
<p>I'm impressed with the easy and quality of the free software available to virtualise computers!  </p>
<p>In case you're new to virtualisation of computers; roughly speaking, a virtual computer is 'software behaving like a full computer'. </p>
<p>When your home computer is about to die, or you have the extra $$ to buy a more powerfull machine, then you can move your virtual computer by 'copy and pasting' a folder (kinda)...</p>
<p>I'm also using virutalisation to run Ubuntu in Windows and Windows in Ubuntu - now how silly is that ;-)</p>
