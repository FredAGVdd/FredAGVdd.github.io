<p>Today, between 8.30 and 12 noon, I've logged on to various networks, services, computers (physical and virtual). </p>
<p>I estimate having used 20 different user/password combinations so far.  I say "estimate", as I always loose count (and refuse to make ticks on my desk or any paper for that matter) ...</p>
<p>Single Sign On has come a long way since its inception.  It sure helps a a great deal not having re-key your credentials time and time again in Windows.<br />
Still, there's plenty of logging on to do when you're a bit of a IT dude...</p>
<p>Anno 2011 I hardly know any phone numbers by heart, yet passwords and password formulae are scattered around that good ol grey matter.<br />
Also a 'password wallet' tool is handly, especially when returning from a nice mind clearing holiday...</p>
