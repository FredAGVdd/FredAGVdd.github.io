<p>Internet Explorer 7 (... yes, I know...) uses / a microsoft site where i need to download 600MB from advises to use the (Microsoft) ActiveX component "Microsoft File Transfer Manager"</p>
<p>In the "good old days" FTP might have been considered ?</p>
<p>Nowadays, I prefer to download &amp; browse in general using Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, on Ubuntu.</p>
<p>And these days, it's not like one can 'blame Bill' (anymore)... So, where's the fun now?</p>
<p>Follow the white pinguin!</p>
