<p>Another day, another moan?  It's just a comment really...</p>
<p>The 'Search Everywhere' and 'Search Internet' Window Vista option seem a bit... 'weird'.</p>
<p>Everywhere seems to exclude the Internet, commonly seen as 'everything everywhere'. Instead, Everywhere seems to be 'indexed locations' only. And... Microsoft strongly recommends against indexing the entirety of a pc, and instead advises to focus on the user's individual folders (e.g. Documents, Pictures and the likes) ... Basically, 'Search Everywhere' in Vista is roughly the same as 'Search My Documents'! ;-)</p>
<p>I've made up my mind, also on Vista, Google Desktop will be my first point of call...</p>
