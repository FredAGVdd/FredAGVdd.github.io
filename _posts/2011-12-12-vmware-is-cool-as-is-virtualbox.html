<p>And probably quite a few more virtualization technologies fit the glove, but you can't, or should not, or maybe one should be, use them all at the same time ?!</p>
<p>Next on the agenda, how to convert from one virutalization technology stack to the other, AWS EC2 &lt;==&gt; VMWare &lt;==&gt; Virtual Box.   What are the restrictions? There are none. Virtualize and hack! :-)</p>
