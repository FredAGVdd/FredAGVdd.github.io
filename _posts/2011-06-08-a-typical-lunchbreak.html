<p>I like cooking best when serving other people. By consequence, my lunch menu often features sandwiches, to be eaten with one hand.  The other hand is needed on the keyboard.</p>
<p>Today's instalment: Dutch Gouda Cheese, British Ham and German salami.<br />
Mix that with some "cloud computing on Gemstone", seaside, cygWin, perl, vmware, ssh and you end up with an invigorating salad. Yum.</p>
<p>What's for desert?  JSPs :-|</p>
