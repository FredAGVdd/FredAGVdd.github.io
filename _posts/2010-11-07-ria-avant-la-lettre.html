<p>RIA is hot!</p>
<p>I'm not referring to my wife's friend in Antwerp.</p>
<p>I am meaning to reflect on Rich Internet Applications.</p>
<p>These are *hot* - have been for a while and are due to be for a while longer, albeit likely under a different guise.</p>
<p>I remember using JavaScript to build little windows inside a web page, back in 1999. And this is why I want to reflect on RIA now, autumn 2010.</p>
<p>to be continued...</p>
<p><em>What about AIR?</em><br />
Kelly watch the stars ... or and Adobe product ...<br />
;-)</p>
