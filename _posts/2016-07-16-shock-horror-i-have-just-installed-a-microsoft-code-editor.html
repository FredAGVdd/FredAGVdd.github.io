What's happening out there in Seattle?!?  

Shock number 1: <a href="http://www.cio.com/article/3026664/open-source-tools/the-real-reason-microsoft-open-sourced-net.html">This CIO.com post</a> explains why Microsoft chose to open source their flagship code editor.
<blockquote>“As we pursue our vision of the fabric and the cloud anywhere, that is as much a story about supporting Linux workloads as it is Windows workloads,” says lead architect for Windows Server, Jeffery Snover.  </blockquote>
Shock number 2: the editor is actually an application running in Chrome (at least on Ubuntu it is.  Is that also true for the Windows version?)

"Reassurance":
<ul>
<li>Looping through the colour themes is not *fun*, you have to reopen the menu after every theme you chose.</li>
<li>The up/down arrows and page up/down keys don't work in the extension list view.</li>
<li>Default installation/configuration suggests changing the tag &lt:blockquote&gt; to &lt:block quote&gt;.  "Solid"<br/>Actually, found out afterwards, that had to do with the .md (markdown) extension of the file I was editing (this post)</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

 **.NET** is open source?!? Read all about it: <a href="http://www.cio.com/article/3007061/open-source-tools/10-products-that-big-tech-companies-have-open-sourced-recently.html#slide7">10 products that big tech companies have open-sourced recently</a>
<blockquote style="text-align: left">
It made headlines when Microsoft open-sourced its powerful .NET framework in late 2014, with many heralding the news as proof that Microsoft – formerly the great bete noire of open-source – had turned a corner.
