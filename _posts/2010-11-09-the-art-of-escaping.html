<p>Only prisoners with the liberty of learning on-line about the art of escaping characters (not  breaking jail), and BEA Portal Content Management developers may find this useful...</p>
<p>I've been using ExpressionHelper.parse(stmtStr) to parse my statement stmtStr.</p>
<p>Recently, some of the meta data changed, and this introduced a single quote &#039; in the value I'm using to compare a property with, e.g. to_property(&#039;Repo\Type1&#039;,&#039;Poperty1&#039;) = &#039;Boys&#039; Books&#039;</p>
<p>This caused the ExpressionHelper to fail parsing, as the single quote was not escaped...</p>
<p>ExpressionHelper JavaDoc says backslash is the escaping character</p>
<p>to_property(&#039;Repo\Type1&#039;,&#039;Poperty1&#039;) = &#039;Boys\&#039; Books&#039;   </p>
<p>Right?  Wrong! --&gt; This results in exactly the same parsing exception.</p>
<p>to_property(&#039;Repo\Type1&#039;,&#039;Poperty1&#039;) = &#039;Boys\\\&#039; Books&#039; </p>
<p>Right?  Wrong! --&gt; The parsing exception is no longer, but now the underlying SQL Server doesn't like the SQL syntax produced very much...</p>
<p>to_property(&#039;Repo\Type1&#039;,&#039;Poperty1&#039;) = &#039;Boys\\\&#039;\\\&#039; Books&#039; </p>
<p>Right!  And so ... this is how a single quote &#039; becomes \\\&#039;\\\&#039; ...</p>
