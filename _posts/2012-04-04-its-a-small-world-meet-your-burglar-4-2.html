<p>Yesterday, I was sat on the 222 bus to Uxbridge with ... the fella that burgled my home last year.</p>
<p>Obviously, I would not know this fella, if</p>
<p>- he had not left his fingerprint on a (only!) half-finished bottle of Leffe bruin<br />- the Crown Prosecution Service did not take him to Harrow Crown Court<br />- I did not go testify in this case ...</p>
<p>Obviously, all of the above DID happen :-)</p>
<p>I can put a smiley now, but there and then I did feel a little intimidated.  Where it not for his gentle persistent approach, we would not have spoken! (I would have kept wondering whom I saw on the bus...)  But now, it's all so much clearer, that grey sky :-)  The only thing is, I'm still short two laptops, one of which has months of tedious configuring stuff on it ... </p>
