<p>before a 1200 minute recording finishes, to be followed by 'chasing the dark matter'.  Yes, I like star gazing, but this is Java heap related... :-|  </p>
<p>Talk about fragmentation...  MissionControl (sounds very 'spacey' doesn't it just), VisualVM and MemoryAnalyzer are the tools at hand.</p>
<p>What/Which are these objects <em>hanging around</em>?  Are they caused by human error, and if so, mine or that of a WebLogic server/portal programmer - not to mention all the 3rd party libs in use.  It'll be a nice Thursday afternoon!</p>
