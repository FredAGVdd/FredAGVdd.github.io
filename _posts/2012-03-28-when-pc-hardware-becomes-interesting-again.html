<p>When I started computing, hardware was everything - Commodore 64 / IBM PC 8088. Software was what we were writing.<a href="/assets/beagleboard.jpg"></p>

<p>Following years, computers became more powerful (progression) - and I slowly lost interest in hardware.</p>
<p>Discovering that VMWare needs certain CPU models to function properly made me realize this lack of interest in  (every so quickly changing) hardware needs changing.</p>
